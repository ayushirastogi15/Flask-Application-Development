# Flask-Application-Development-for-Speech-Recognition

## What is Flask ?

Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build web-applications in a very easy and friendly way. It is a web-application framework which is based on WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Read more about flask from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-introduction-to-web-development-using-flask/).

## What is Speech Recognition ?

Speech Recognition is a technique where we can convert or transcribe or recognize speech into its corresponding text. We can use various python libraries to do that. Some of the libraries are SpeechRecognition, deepspeech, google-cloud-speech, watson-developer-cloud, wit, etc. You can look at [this](https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/) and [this](https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/definition/speech-recognition) website to know more about the speech recognition. It really helped me in understanding the concept and the workings behind these libraries.  

## Speech to Text Transcription using Flask application

This repository tells you how to develop a flask application for the speech recognition task where you can directly upload any audio file or record your own audio as well to get the transcripted text. I have used SpeechRecognition library to recognize the speech and convert it into text. You can use any library as per your requirements and suitability. You can check this [link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3) which gives you the step by step process of how to install a Flask Web Application. You can also go through this [github example](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/microphone_recognition.py) to explore more options to do the speech recognition. 

For the installation of SpeechRecognition library see [this](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/).
